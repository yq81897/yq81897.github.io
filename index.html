<p>Hi everyone, <strong>my name is Sugar</strong>, a girl who is 6 months old.
<br>I am Domestic Medium Hair. Also, I have mix Black and Brown furs.
<br>I was born in May 28th,2018. But I was abandoned by the last owner when I was only two months old...
<br>I was abandoned on a highway, where vehicles driving very fast.
<br>I felt so scared and hungry. 
<br>I wanted to find some food, however,it was hard for me, a 6-months-old girl to move on the highway.
<br>Such days lasted for several days.</p>

<P><b>... ...</b></P>

<P><strong>Luckily! There was some one found me on the highway and took me to the Oconee Country Animal Shelter!!</strong>
<br>I got food, clean water and treatment there. More important thins was, I felt people's love there.
<br>My new owner appeared in front of me at August 19th,2018.
<br>I saw her through the glasses. She looked so nice. She gently knocked on the glasses in order to attract my attention.
<br>I felt nervous but excited. Maybe I am able to have my own family like other cats.
<br>The girl, she finally decided to take me back to her home and gave me a new name in Chinese, which is<i> JiangYou</i>.
<br>Umm..Actually I did not know Chinese but I guess maybe it is same as the English word "soy sauce".
<br>Maybe it is because of my furs color...?
<br>Whatever, I finally have my own family with three lovely girls, and <strong>my new life began!</strong></p>

<h1 style="background-color:#7575a3">My Daily Schedule</h1>
<p> My owner is a student who studying in UGA, so she has to go to school everyday in early morning and comes back home in the afternoon.
<br>To be honest, I was sad and bored at the beginning. And I tried to find something interesting during that time.
